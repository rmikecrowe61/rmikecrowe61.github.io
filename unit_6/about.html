               <p>Mike decided to form this group based on the philosophy that ideas are fostered and enhanced when skill sets and creativity are brought together in a collaberative environment.</p><br><br>


               <p>City Wide Web Development is more of an idea than an organization. Mike Crowe has spent the past 25+ years in the manufacturing and software industry, and has seen many great software minds fail in efforts to break out in independent start-up companies. Having several "Subject Matter Experts", means that we can find a combination of solutions that creates the ideal end product for our clients.</p><br><br>

              <p>City Wide has built a team that is not only technically skilled, but also has the capability to understand your business. Our team consists of experienced software strategis, designers and developers, who have collectively designed and built 100s of apps. In order to optimize the usability of your app, our design thinking is not limited to graphics, but instead is focused first on your client experience. Our team has the experience and expertise necessary to get your project done right, and within your budget.</p><br><br>
